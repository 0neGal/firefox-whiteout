## What is this?

I have a collection of themes for a various amounts of apps, I happened to have stopped using Firefox and so I call this theme to be finished. It automatically gets colors from your GTK theme. This allows to have a unified look to Firefox while it remains minimal.

On the topic of stopping to use Firefox, I'll probably release `qute-whiteout` at some point down the line.
